# CLI Shortener

This is a basic tool which shortens your URL using bit.ly API, on the fly.

You need to configure the API Keys manually.


# Installation

```bash
git clone github.com/regmicmahesh-org/url_shortener_cli
cd url_shorter_cli
#Edit main.go to add your API Key.
go install .
```

Now, just type `shortener_clipboard` in your terminal and you're good to go.
